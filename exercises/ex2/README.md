# Exercise 2 - Configure Worklist and Object Page Header Entities

Schemas define which information appears in the document Worklist and in each document’s object page header.
This configuration allows tailoring the user interface to specific business needs. For example, when processing invoices, displaying the supplier name and total amount in the Worklist can make locating the correct invoice faster.

This exercise configures these settings for the **Company Registry Extract** schema.
